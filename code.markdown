Here are some of my projects. If you are interested in what my skills are, please checkout my [LinkedIn profile][0] for a up-to-date resume.

## [github][1] repository ##
Most of my current software and hacks can be found on my github profile. I try to upload as much as I feel I can here.

## [Skanova Skadeanmälan][2] for iPhone ##
Skanova Skadeanmälan is developed together with [Skanova][3] the biggest infrastructure company in Sweden. They wanted an App that could report damage on their infrastructure. The user of the application can report damage by taking an image and attaching the phones GPS position. The error report is then sent by email to the response team at Skanova.

## [Mobilblogg][4] for iPhone
My first iPhone app is a photo oriented application for the Swedish photo community [Mobilblogg][5]. It was developed together with the main developer for Mobilblogg. I did all the client side code, debugged the API. The application was created with the excellent [Three20][6] framework, developed by [facebook][7]. An update is pending and might be released whenever I find the time.

## [XMMS2][8]
> You might have heard of [XMMS][9], the hugely popular Winamp clone for Linux and UNIX-like operating systems. XMMS2 is a project started (in late 2002) by one of XMMS's original authors - Peter Alm - to produce a "kick-ass music player" (much like the world's 347349739921 other music player projects). In short, XMMS2 is the next generation XMMS.

I was one of the people that joined Peter to try to develop XMMS2. For many years I was the release manager and project manager of the project. [A lot of my code][10] is still in the current release. I chose to retire in 2009 after almost 8 years involved in the project. I wrote mainly C, Python and C++ in XMMS2.
