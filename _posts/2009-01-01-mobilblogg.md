My first iPhone app is a photo oriented application for the Swedish photo community [Mobilblogg][1]. It was developed together with the main developer for Mobilblogg. I did all the client side code, debugged the API. The application was created with the excellent [Three20][2] framework, developed by [facebook][3]. An update is pending and might be released whenever I find the time.
