If you haven't checked out [Plex][1] yet, you really should! It's a great HTPC solution, not only streaming to your machine connected to the TV, but also to mobile devices like iPhone, iPad and Android.

The fine folks over at [Plex][1] have released a Linux version of the Plex Media Server (the engine so to speak). It works great with my AppleTV Gen 2, iPhone and iPad (except some subtitle issues that hopefully will be resolved soon). Anyway, they released all this as a nice .tar.gz. Helpful but not really what a APT junkie like I need. So I repackaged their software into a Ubuntu package. You can get my *debian* scripts on my [github][2] page.

I don't distribute the final .deb for people to use yet, but the Plex Team [contacted me][3] (and showed me some nerdy male love), so we might be able to work something out!

Meanwhile, refer to the README in the github page and build away! Please email me if you have any problems.
