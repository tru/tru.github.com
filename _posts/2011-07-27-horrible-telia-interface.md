Telia Digital TV PVR sucks. I just spent ages trying to remove recorded shows from it. There are so many UI annoyances all over the product that they are to many to list, but the remove interface must take the price. This is how you remove shows:

* You scroll to the bottom, because you want to remove the oldest entries right?
* Click remove, note that you can only remove ONE entry at the time
* You confirm that you want to remove this show
* You wait for 40-60 seconds while it removes the show
* The list scrolls to the top
* goto 1

The developers can't have tested this system on more than a couple of shows. I have over 100 now.

Great fun.
