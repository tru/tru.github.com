> You might have heard of [XMMS][1], the hugely popular Winamp clone for Linux and UNIX-like operating systems. XMMS2 is a project started (in late 2002) by one of XMMS's original authors - Peter Alm - to produce a "kick-ass music player" (much like the world's 347349739921 other music player projects). In short, XMMS2 is the next generation XMMS.

I was one of the people that joined Peter to try to develop XMMS2. For many years I was the release manager and project manager of the project. [A lot of my code][2] is still in the current release. I chose to retire in 2009 after almost 8 years involved in the project. I wrote mainly C, Python and C++ in XMMS2.
