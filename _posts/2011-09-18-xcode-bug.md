title: XCode4 import developer profile - Could not locate file within archive

I ran into a really annoying bug with XCode4 today when I was trying to move my developer profile to another account (for setting up hudson). I had no problems exporting my developer profile from the XCode Organizer, but whenever I tried to import it I got this very strange error message: "Could not locate file within archive". I tried to google this, but without results.

I noticed that the .developerprofile file was a ZIP archive and unzipped it to inspect what was in it. This is what I found:

{% highlight bash %}
Archive:  profile.developerprofile
DTDKDeveloperProfile closing
  inflating: developer/identities/iPhone Developer: Tobias Rundstr+?m (XXXXXXX).p12  
  inflating: developer/profiles/XXXXXXXX.mobileprovision  
{% endhighlight %}

Hmm, that unicode stuff there looks suspicous (fun fact, I was named Tobias Rundstr√∂m before I got married and changed my surname to Hieta). I renamed the file with my name to something more 7-bit friendly and then zipped the file back up with the command

{% highlight bash %}
zip -r profile.developerprofile developer
{% endhighlight %}

And this solved the problem! If you have this problem and your realname contains some 8-bit characters try to inspect that developerprofile file and see if it helps, certainly did for me!
